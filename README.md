# Tkinter_rock_paper_scissors

This code will allow you to have a window pop up, write your name, and see if the user would like to play.

If yes is selected, then the user gets a choice between Game 1 & Game 2. 

For this code, GAME 1 will work, however GAME2 will just inform you that it is heads or tails. From the code from the rock, paper, scissors game (GAME 1), it is up to you to create the heads or tails game! Good luck.
